        <h2>father of our Nation</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Mahatma Gandhiji </b>is revered in India as the Father of the
          Nation. Much before the Constitution of Free India conferred the title
          of the Father of the Nation upon the Mahatma, it was Netaji Subhash
          Chandra Bose who first addressed him as such in his condolence message
          to the Mahatma on the demise of Kasturba. Ba and Bapu had been
          interned at Aga Khan Palace, Pune in the wake of the Quit India
          Movement. It was while serving the prison term Kasturba passed away on
          22 February, 1944. Concerned about Gandhiji, Netaji sent the following
          message to the Mahatma on Azad Hind Radio, Rangoon on 4th June, 1944.
          "...........Nobody would be more happy than ourselves if by any chance
          our countrymen at home should succeed in liberating themselves through
          their own efforts or by any chance, the British Government accepts
          your `Quit India' resolution and gives effect to it. We are, however
          proceeding on the assumption that neither of the above is possible and
          that a struggle is inevitable. Father of our Nation in this holy war
          for India's liberation, we ask for your blessings and good wishes".
          The above message also proves beyond any doubt Netaji's reverence and
          warm feelings towards Gandhiji whom he had addressed as 'The Father of
          the Nation'. There have been many queries as to how could Gandhi be
          called the Father of an ancient civilization like ours. No one is
          questioning the antiquity of this ancient land. But India, that is
          Bharat as we know today that has emerged out of an old civilization is
          a recent phenomenon. This multicultural multi-ethnic country became a
          Nation-State owing allegiance to one Constitution, one flag and one
          Government only on 15 August, 1947. Mahatma Gandhi crystallized about
          him the living forces of the soil. So it seemed to a vast millions of
          Indians, and who saw a Father figure in him and whose `Bapu' he was.
